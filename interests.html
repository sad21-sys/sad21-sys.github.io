<dt>Reading</dt>
        <dd>I have recently started reading for enjoyment rather than for classes. Before I thought reading was a chore but now it is a way to transport me into new worlds, gain new information and experience things I would never be able to in my lifetime.</dd>
        <dd>My favorite book is <ins>Silent Patient</ins> by <em> Alex Michaelides</em>.</dd>

        <dt>Movies</dt>
        <dd>Movies are way for me to relax I usually watch the same movies over and over agin rather than looking for new movies. <abbr title="I Like What I Like">ILWIL</abbr> </dd>
<dd> My favorite movies consist of <em> Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em>,<em> Real Steel</em>,<em> </em>and<em> 10 Things I Hate About You</em>.

        <dt>Spikeball</dt>
        <dd>I love playing spike ball with my brothers. We are all very competitive and we are each others rivals.</dd>
        
        <dt>Walks</dt>
        <dd> Before I left for college I would walk my puppies around our park with my family. I had so much fun and my puppies had a great time too. </dd>
        <dd> Now that I am in college I walk around campus sometimes. Especially up to the cross because I think it is beautiful up there.</dd>
